Project Overview & Basic Findings

This project details the complete design of a centrifugal separator for a milk fractionation plant. The primary goal of this unit is to separate fat (cream) from raw, pasteurised milk to produce skimmed milk, which then proceeds to microfiltration and ultrafiltration to create whey and casein protein supplements.
Basic Findings & Design Parameters:

Unit Selected: Tetra Pak H80 Centrifugal Separator
Optimal Flowrate: 61,800 kg/hr
Target Separation Efficiency: 95%

Calculated Product Streams:

Skim Milk (Product): 58,710 kg/hr
Cream (By-product): 3,090 kg/hr

Operating Conditions: 50Â°C and 650 kPa

Key Analyses: The report includes comprehensive material and energy balances, detailed mechanical design of components (bowl, piping, motor), and a performance evaluation considering pressure drop, fouling, and the non-Newtonian properties of milk.
Safety & Control: A full P&ID, control strategy (PID loops), and process safety analysis (HAZID & LOPA) were developed to ensure safe and reliable operation in accordance with ASME B31.3 and ASME BPVC Section VIII codes.
